## 🎯 Mission Brief

After completing a series of challenging modules, Agent Maker, you're now ready for your most critical step yet: publishing your agent. It's time to make your creation available to users across Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## 🔎 Objectives

In this mission, you'll learn:
